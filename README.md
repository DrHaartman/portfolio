Portfolio Website
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, a single-page application built with HTML and CSS. The site is designed to showcase my skills, interests, and educational background as I pursue a career in software development.

About the Project
The portfolio is a static webpage that acts as a digital resume and a central hub for my professional information. It's built to be clean and easy to navigate, featuring a simple header with a navigation bar that links to different sections of the page. The content is organized into distinct sections:

About Me: An introduction to my background and passion for technology.

Interests: A summary of my interests in web development, AI, and problem-solving.

Educational Background: A timeline of my academic journey, highlighting my diverse educational pursuits in both nursing and computer science.

Programming Languages: A list of the languages I am currently proficient in.

Projects: A placeholder for future projects to be showcased.

Contact Me: A form and contact information for visitors to get in touch.

Technologies Used
The website is built using fundamental web development technologies:

HTML: The core structure of the webpage, organizing the content into a logical flow.

CSS: Handles the styling and layout, including colors, fonts, and the responsive design.

How to Run the Code
This is a static website, so you can view it directly in any web browser. To see the website:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

Customization
If you'd like to use this code as a template for your own portfolio, you can easily customize it.

Replace the image Image 1.jpg with a picture of yourself. Make sure to update the src attribute in the HTML.

Update the text in each section (About Me, Interests, etc.) to reflect your personal information.

In the CSS, modify the colors and fonts to match your personal style.

This portfolio serves as a foundation for showcasing my growth as a developer. I plan to add more dynamic features and project examples as I continue my journey in software engineering.
